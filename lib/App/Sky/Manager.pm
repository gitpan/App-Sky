=head1 METHODS

=head2 config

The configuration of the app as passed through the configuration file.

=head2 my $results = $sky->get_upload_results({ filenames => ["Shine4U.webm"], });

Gives the recipe to execute for the upload commands.

Accepts one argument that is a hash reference with these keys:

=over 4

=item * 'filenames'

An array reference containing strings to upload. Currently only supports
one filename.

=item * 'section'

An optional section that will override the target section. If not specified,
the uploader will try to guess based on the fileâ€™s basename and the manager
configuration.

=item * 'target_dir'

Overrides the target directory for the upload, to ignore that dictated by
the sections. Should point to a string.

=back

Returns a L<App::Sky::Results> reference containing:

=over 4

=item * upload_cmd

The upload command to execute (as an array reference of strings).

=back

=head2 my $results = $sky->get_recursive_upload_results({ filenames => ['/home/music/Music/mp3s/Basic Desire/'], });

Gives the recipe to execute for the recursive upload commands.

Accepts one argument that is a hash reference with these keys:

=over 4

=item * 'filenames'

An array reference containing paths to directories. Currently only supports
one filename.

=item * 'section'

An optional section that will override the target section. If not specified,
the uploader will try to use the 'dirs_section' section.

=item * 'target_dir'

Overrides the target directory for the upload, to ignore that dictated by
the sections. Should point to a string.

=back

Returns a L<App::Sky::Results> reference containing:

=over 4
